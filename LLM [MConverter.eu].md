DAY – 1 LLM FOUNDATION

Evolution of LLM:

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-creating machines with human-like thinking
and behavior.

Machine Learning(ML),a subset of AI,allows computers to learn patterns
from data and make predictions without explicit programming.

Neural Networks (NNs),a subset of ML, mimic the human brain's structure
and are crucial in deep learning algorithms.

Deep Learning (DL),a subset of NN,is effective for complex
problem-solving, as seen in image recognition and language translation
technologies.

Generative AI (GenAI), a subset of DL, can create diverse content based
on learned patterns.

Large Language Models (LLMs),a form of GenAI, specialize in generating
human-like text by learning from extensive textual data.

<span class="mark">Generative AI and Large Language Models
(LLMs)</span>:

-  capable of multi-tasking, performing tasks like summarization, Q&A,
  and classification out-of-the-box.

- training of generative AI often involves supervised learning

- example of early generative AI is the Markov chain

<span class="mark">GAN:</span>

- Generative adversarial networks (GANs) emerged, using two models
  working together—one generating output other discriminating real data
  from the generated output. 

- improved the realism of generated content.

<span class="mark">Google introduced the transformer architecture, a
breakthrough in natural language processing. Transformers encode each
word as a token, generating an attention map that captures relationships
between tokens. This attention to context enhances the model's ability
to generate coherent text, exemplified by large language models like
ChatGPT.</span>

**LLM Expansion:**

-  "Large"- amplifies their capabilities-In terms of the size of their
  architecture and the vast amount of data they are trained on.

-  "Language Models"- algorithms or systems that are trained to
  understand and generate human-like text.

-  representation of how language works, learning from diverse datasets
  to predict what words or sequences of words are likely to come next in
  a given context.

Traditional language models- smaller in scale and couldn't capture the
intricacies of language as effectively.

**Training LLMs**

1.  **Providing Input Text:**

> Input from sources such as books, articles, and websites.The model's
> task during training is to predict the next word or token .

2.  **Optimizing Model Weights:**

> weights are fine-tuned to minimize the error rate. The objective is to
> enhance the model's accuracy in predicting the next word.

3.  **Fine-tuning Parameter Values:**

> LLMs continuously adjust parameter values based on error feedback
> received during predictions.

<span class="mark">LLM performance is heavily influenced by two key
factors:</span>

- **Model Architecture:**  impact its ability to capture language
  nuances.

- **Dataset:** The quality and diversity of the dataset utilized for
  training are crucial in shaping the model's language understanding.

<span class="mark">There are three prevalent learning models</span>:

1.  **Zero-shot learning:** The base LLMs can handle a wide range of
    requests without explicit training, often by using prompts, though
    the accuracy of responses.

2.  **Few-shot learning:**  providing a small number of training
    examples, the performance of the base model significantly improves
    in a specific domain.

3.  **Domain Adaptation:** This extends from few-shot learning, where
    practitioners train a base model to adjust its parameters using
    additional data relevant to the particular application or domain.
